# Currently **not** works as it should. This is in **alpha**.

# Windows icon applier

## Warning
This is an experiment, written using NodeJS. It is **not** production ready.

## Installing dependencies:
1. Install NodeJS > 8.5.0 (make sure it is in your path!)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/wilkgr76/windows_icon_applier`
3. Run `npm install` to install depedencies. 

## Running
After installing dependencies, run `npm test` to run. **Note**: You'll need to modify it to use where shortcuts are stored. For now, I'm using a seperate folder locally. :yum:

## TODO
[ ] Actually modify the shortcuts!
[ ] Allow backup of default icons
